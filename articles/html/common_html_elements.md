## Creating Your First HTML Page

In this article, we will embark on an exciting journey of creating our first HTML page. By the end of this article, you will have a basic understanding of how to set up your development environment, create an HTML file, and use the most fundamental HTML tags.

### Setting Up the Development Environment

Before we start writing our HTML code, we need to set up our development environment. This environment consists of a text editor and a web browser.

1. **Text Editor:** This is where you will write your HTML code. There are many text editors available, but some of the most popular ones include [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/), [Atom](https://atom.io/), and [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). Choose one that suits you best.

2. **Web Browser:** This is where you will view your HTML page. Any modern web browser like Google Chrome, Firefox, or Safari will work perfectly.

### Creating an HTML File

Now, let's create our first HTML file:

1. Open your text editor and create a new file.
2. Save the file with a `.html` extension. For example, you can name it `index.html`.
3. Congratulations! You've created your first HTML file.

### Writing Basic HTML

Now that we have our HTML file, let's write some basic HTML code. An HTML document is made up of `doctype`, `html`, `head`, `title`, and `body` tags.

-  **`<!DOCTYPE html>`:** This declaration helps with the proper rendering of the webpage by the browser. It's the very first thing in your HTML document.

-  **`<html>`:** This is the root element of an HTML page.

-  **`<head>`:** This element contains meta-information about the HTML document that isn't displayed on the page itself.

-  **`<title>`:** This tag specifies the title of the webpage. The title is displayed in the browser's title bar or tab.

-  **`<body>`:** This tag contains the content that is displayed on the webpage.

Here's what these tags look like in action:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
   <head>
      <title>My First Web Page</title>
   </head>
   <body>
      Hello, World!
   </body>
</html>
```
